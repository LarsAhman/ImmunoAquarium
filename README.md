# ImmunoAquarium
An aquarium representing our immune system. 
Just open the index.html in your browser to start it. 
The white objects try to destroy the red objects, 
which try to destroy the stationary green objects in order to heal. 
For reds and whites, size affects speed and health. 
They can reproduce, passing on their traits, but there is also mutation. 
The successful ones get to heal and therefore reproduce more. 
This all means that the aquariums tenants should be self balancing and live in an equilibrium, 
but the initial traits still need some balancing from my part.
