hmmm:

if intruder big enough, becomes juggernaut, (not afraid of whitecells)


-----------
yes:
+smaller whiteCell = faster, but slower damage
+bigger whiteCell = slower, but faster damage
+cells reproduce and die

+intruders run away
+intruders try to damage the health system

+intruders, larger = damage faster, more hp
+smaller = move faster

intruders regenerate if not touching white cells
killing a defence makes the intruder rampage against white cells and immune to damage for x seconds
defences supply HP for whiteCells

a new defence spawns every 5th kill
